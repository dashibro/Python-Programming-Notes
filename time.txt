# Time Moudle in Python
    The time module in Python is your go-to for working with time-related tasksâ€”whether
    you're measuring execution speed, adding delays,
    or formatting timestamps.

# Key Features:
- Access the current time
- Format and convert time values
- Pause execution (like sleep)
- Measure performance

# Importent Funtions in Time Module:

    # Get current time in seconds since epoch
    time.time()

    # Pause execution for given seconds
    time.sleep(seconds)

    # Convert seconds to readable string
    time.ctime(secs)

    # Convert seconds to UTC struct_time
    time.gmtime(secs)

    # Convert seconds to local struct_time
    time.localtime(secs)

    # Format struct_time to string
    time.strftime(format, t)

    # Parse string to struct_time
    time.strptime(string, format)

    # Convert struct_time to seconds since epoch
    time.mktime(t)

    # High-resolution performance counter
    time.perf_counter()

    # CPU time used by current process
    time.process_time()

    # Monotonic clock (never goes backward)
    time.monotonic()


# Example code:
    import time

    start = time.time()
    time.sleep(1)
    end = time.time()

    print(f"Elapsed time: {end - start:.2f} seconds")
